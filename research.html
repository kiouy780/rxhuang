<dt><b>Deep Learning Based Droplet and Bubble Identification Method for 
In Vitro Diagnostic Devices <a href="FYP2022_RXH.pdf">[PDF]</b></a></dt><br />
<p><b>Advisor: Frank J. Xu</b></p>
<p>With the development of modern medicine, accurate, efficient and convenient in vitro diagnostic devices play an important role in medical diagnosis, which contains key technologies such as filling-up, washing and measurement, and the lack of breakthroughs in these technologies can greatly affect the diagnostic results and efficiency, but the current research on these issues is not sufficient. </p>
<p>In this paper, we focus on the droplet counting problem in the filling-up process of in vitro diagnostic devices, analyze the problem from theoretical and practical perspectives, and realize real-time monitoring and accurate counting of droplets, respectively. </p>
<p>In the theoretical aspect, this paper models the droplet in the vertical capillary based on the Young-Laplace control equation, numerically simulates its shape when only the inner diameter and the nature of the reagent are known, and then models two anomalies in the actual operation of the in vitro testing equipment, analyzes the mechanics separately, and eliminates the anomalies.</p> 
<p>In the practical aspect, this paper applies the Hough transform to the real-time detection of irregularly shaped droplets and trains the YOLO model applicable to droplet identification, combines the parameters obtained from the theoretical part, and develops droplet counting algorithms based on the above two methods, whose accuracy rates are 95% and 100%, respectively.</p>
<p>Finally, this paper contributes to the improvement of the accuracy and productivity of in vitro detection technology.</p>
